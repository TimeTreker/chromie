# Development Checkpoint

## Current delivery boundary — Issue #40 GA repair preservation

Updated 2026-09-11. The owner approved freezing the complete first GA output,
allowing at most one provably lossless structural repair, and deterministic
comparison before acceptance. GA retains raw output before preprocessing;
unknown fields, invalid optional meaning, malformed Goal references and conflicting
segmentation decisions reject. Only existing object/singleton-array shape changes qualify after complete
DTO/source/conservation preflight; changed semantics or over-budget input reject.
Resource bindings may move only to an unambiguous active owner without data loss.
No additional model invocation, architecture owner, service or switch was added.

Delivery base: `main` at `15f2a45c73a38e63a7274639d07b2ad544025e92`, tracking
`origin/main`. Continue the owner's existing commit/push instruction. Resume from
the latest commit containing this checkpoint and HANDOFF; do not predict its hash.
Evidence: `.chromie/acceptance/issue40-ga-semantic-preservation-20260911/`.
The original two-return probe accepted continue -> cancel after an extra-key error.
Both identical probes now reject after one call because unknown-key deletion is
not provably lossless. Separate shape-only contrasts permit one repair and reject
changed relation, target, scope, values, Goal count/order and source references.
Focused 167 tests/142 subtests; canonical 2,428/715, 140 benchmarks, 20 legacy
passed. New preservation 13/23 and selected Level A 30/30 also passed.
Rejected cancellation leaves real local Goal state unchanged. This is scripted
contract/state evidence, not model, voice, provider or target qualification.
Ignored evidence does not transfer with Git; exact workflow/commands are in HANDOFF.

Prior #37–#39 and GI speed rejection were delivered in the baseline commit.
Its canonical 2,415 tests/692 subtests, 140 benchmarks, 20 legacy tests and
Level A 30/30 passed; those results do not qualify this new GA change.
Other GI normalizers, numeric source extraction beside a period, #41–#48, full
merge/split, model optimization and deployment remain outside this approval.
No corpus input or reference output was changed in this GA patch. The earlier
1,500-reference representation migration belongs to #39, with meaning unchanged.
Historical #37 implementation/evidence follows; use this top entry for current resume.

## Prior local implementation — Issue #37, 2026-09-11

Active Issue #35; Goal-driven single-authority architecture. The owner explicitly
authorized the discussed Charter and
implementation amendments: independent GI-/GA-triggered Planner calls, scoped
Work revision, actual Runtime/Evidence continuity, and existing Memory role
projections. The owner separately confirmed that existing Capability contracts
may admit safe reads before GA; other Work may only be prepared. This specific
amendment is authorized despite the prior evidence-only delivery constraint.
Other audit findings and the separate Fast tagged-stream wire proposal remain
outside scope. No additional optimization iteration, model/provider change,
deployment, commit or push was performed.

Checkout: `/home/chromie/github/chromie`, branch `main`, uncommitted patch over
`a0c5d09fbb18fca8660aa43abb55bccca18924cc`. Source and tests were initially clean.
Implementation/test/harness patch SHA-256 (documentation excluded):
`16354fd4b0e52c96a30b7077675c2a344a99340b9fa86fe3f9b7f070409efcc6`.
Exact patch, identity and evidence are retained locally under
`.chromie/acceptance/independent-planning-memory-20260911/`.
Ignored artifacts do not transfer with Git; preserve them separately.

## Implemented scope and earliest responsible boundaries

| Boundary | Former mismatch and current mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| Charter -> Planner contract | Principle 25 prohibited all pre-GA Capability execution while architecture/principle 34 allowed safe reads. The authorized rule now permits only complete, validated preparation and available, explicitly side-effect-free safe reads without confirmation; all ordinary Runtime barriers remain. |
| GI/GA -> Planner invocation | GI output starts GA and its own Planner task concurrently. Material committed Goal/Work changes start a distinct Planner call without waiting for the first. Identity-only association remains a mechanical join; neither GI nor GA owns planning. |
| Planner -> Work contract | Complete-group reuse/implicit replacement could not express the agreed partial revision. Planner can reuse a subset, add Work and explicitly select cancel_activity_ids. Omission means unchanged. DTO, dynamic Schema, prompts and Host validation agree. |
| Planner result -> Runtime/Host publication | Scoped snapshots, serialized intersecting commits, exact Plan/fingerprint and single-use version guards reject obsolete submissions before publication and again before dispatch. Shared requests retain one execution identity and require every owning Goal for mutation. |
| Pre-GA read -> canonical execution | Integration exposed different provisional/canonical interaction IDs, losing seeded result reuse. Exact shared identity now binds the original result; real local Runtime regression observes one provider call, before GA. |
| Plan revision -> Goal progress/Evidence | A single latest-Plan binding lost preserved older progress/Evidence and Goal-stop coverage. Existing execution records retain original bindings; Goal views aggregate retained/current Work, accept only exact preserved old Evidence, and stop all owned Plan groups. |
| Memory -> role context | Existing activated, privacy-filtered entries now reach GI, GA and Planner with source, consent and lifetime fields. Cognitive relevance and persistence remain separate; Memory cannot replace current Goal, Work or Evidence truth. |

The current execution sequence and snapshot contract are owned by
[COGNITIVE_TURN_LOOP](docs/COGNITIVE_TURN_LOOP.md); the exact local proof workflow
is retained in [HANDOFF](HANDOFF.md). No standalone design document, architecture
layer, service or configuration switch was added. Maintained Markdown count is
102 -> 102; configuration keys remain 381, public booleans 1, aliases 0.
Existing Memory, Runtime and Goal-state owners were extended.

## Observed verification and limits

Final `./scripts/run_tests.sh` passed: **2,407 tests, 671 subtests,
140 benchmark tests and 20 legacy Agent tests**. Repository policy, test
ownership, pinned Ruff/MyPy, configuration, runtime-structure and documentation
checks passed. Two existing FastAPI startup deprecation warnings remain.
`canonical.log` binds this result to the retained implementation patch;
`canonical-before-retained-evidence.log` is an earlier intermediate result only.

Focused evidence includes independent Planner completion, real local Runtime
safe-read single execution, scoped partial reuse/cancel/add, stale submission
rejection, shared ownership, preserved progress/Evidence, and multi-Plan Goal
cancellation. Relevant files: `publication.log`, `task-delta.log`,
`retained-evidence.log`, `goal-stop.log`; full final gate includes every regression.
The pre-change focused baseline is `baseline.log` (150 tests, 11 subtests).

Selected Level A general-ability acceptance passed **21/21 distinct cases**:
continuous recovery 4/4, deterministic safety 3/3, human-like continuity 4/4,
multiple Goals 10/10, capability grounding 7/7. Class memberships overlap.
`level-a.log` and `level-a/` retain the final run. These are deterministic local
contracts and scheduling evidence, not model inference or interaction-quality
qualification. Provider stubs and the existing Level A scenario fixtures were used;
no physical actions, microphone, audible speaker or deployed service proof ran.

| Implementation | Automated verification | Target validation | Release readiness |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Authorized architecture/contract amendment implemented locally. | Canonical gate and selected Level A classes pass; final documentation check retained separately. | Current patch unqualified for real model, live voice and target runtime. | Development only; default target-evidence closure remains open. |

## Next resume

The owner requested separate discussion and authorization for each audit finding.
[Audit index #36](https://github.com/TimeTreker/chromie/issues/36) links #37 (this
authorized local implementation) and #38 (completed documentation correction),
#39 (semantic inheritance), and #40 (GI speed rejection only). Remaining #40 work
and #41–#48 need separate authorization. Select the next topic with the owner.

1. Inspect `git status --short --branch`, this checkpoint, current Charter and
   HANDOFF. Preserve any subsequent dirty work and existing evidence.
2. Review the authorized amendment as one change. No unresolved owner decision
   blocks this implemented slice; do not infer authorization for the other
   architecture findings, Fast wire change, model optimization or deployment.
3. For any further authorized source edit, run focused regression and the
   canonical gate; keep evidence bound to the exact patch/revision.
4. For newly authorized model/live qualification, bind fresh production prompt,
   Schema, source, provider and runtime identities and run the full frozen cohort.
   The old 29–46 budget remains exhausted; this local amendment does not renew it.
5. Any later Git delivery must update both handoff owners in the same commit.

## Historical evidence preserved

The prior consolidation at the base revision passed 2,392 tests, 671 subtests,
140 benchmarks and 20 legacy tests; selected Level A was 26/26. Its full resume
record is available with `git show a0c5d09f:DEVELOPMENT_CHECKPOINT.md`, and its
workflow remains below the current entry in HANDOFF. Those are base-only counts.

The 4090 Laptop batch 29–46 remains complete and unqualified. Fixed
Qwen3.5:4b Q4_K_M/Ollama; retained repairs 31/32 (GI context) and 43 (GA repair
eligibility). Final GI 46: 44 cases / 61 calls, 3 reviewed qualified; final live
preview: 1 complete failure, 1 partial, 49 unrun. Final original bundle:
`/home/chromie/Downloads/chromie_debug_bundle_20260911_051238.tar.gz`.
Full failures, rejected candidates and provider identities remain in HANDOFF and
`.chromie/acceptance/laptop-more18-20260911/`; none were requalified here.
Soridormi was not edited. The separate native Fast wire proposal stays pending.
